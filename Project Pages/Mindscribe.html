        For my University Final Year report, I decided to perform a study 
        into how Video Games can be used in therapy. Part of this study 
        included developing my own Virtual Reality Video Game in Unreal 
        Engine that could be used to help rehabilitate people who suffer 
        from cognitive impairments, as a result of dementia for example.

    <div class="paragraph">
        Mindscribe is a VR Video Game that implements various skill games 
        such as Sudoku, Snap, and Mathematic Questions. These skill games h
        ave been implemented to encourage and improve cognitive skills such 
        as problem-solving and mathematics.

    <div class="paragraph">
        Each mini-game features its own unique scoring system, which is 
        dependent on a range of features, such as the time it takes to 
        complete a puzzle or the number of lives they have remaining. Each 
        score is then sorted and displayed in a scoreboard allowing players 
        to track their progress.
    </div>

    <div class="paragraph">
        I also implemented an AI, which allows for the implementation of 
        games such as Snap, as the player has something to play against. 
        By including traditional games such as Snap, it creates a feeling 
        of familiarity for users which could help jog their memory.
