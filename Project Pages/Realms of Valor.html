    <div class="paragraph">
        During my final year university module, Advanced Computer Games Development, 
        I was required to develop a VR/AR game using an engine of my choice. I opted 
        to use Unreal Engine 4 while also implementing the 
        <a href="https://docs.opencv.org/3.1.0/index.html" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: underline;">OpenCV Library</a>.
    </div>

    <div class="paragraph">
        The outcome of this module was 'Realms of Valor' which uses a range of features 
        from OpenCV such as colour detection and hand recognition, allowing the player 
        to control the game using various coloured objects as well as their hand.
    </div>

    <div class="paragraph">
        Realms of Valor is a turn-based fighting game where the player takes the role 
        of a Warrior who must combat goblins growing stronger and stronger as they 
        progress. 
    </div>

    <div class="paragraph">
        Combat is controlled through the player holding up coloured objects, the game 
        has been optimised to work with Uno cards, for example, with Red being assigned 
        to an attack move and Green being assigned to heal.
    </div>

    <div class="paragraph">
        Another one of the OpenCV features which has been implemented is hand recognition, 
        after each battle the player earns Skill Points based on their performance, these 
        points can be exchanged for upgrades allowing the player to take on higher-ranked 
        enemies. These upgrades are chosen by the player by holding up a certain number of 
        fingers corresponding to the upgrade they want to perform.
