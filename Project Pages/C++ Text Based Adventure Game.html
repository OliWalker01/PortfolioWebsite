    <div class="paragraph">
        As part of my second-year University module, Object Oriented Systems 
        Development, I was required to develop a text-based Role-Playing Game 
        based loosely on Dungeons and Dragons. The game was developed using 
        C++ with my IDE of choice being Visual Studio 2022.
    </div>

    <div class="paragraph">
        The main character is a Monk who has been tasked with exploring a 
        Dungeon to uncover the treasures that lie within. Along this quest, 
        the Monk encounters Monsters which you the player must overcome!
    </div>

    <div class="paragraph">
        The game features a turn-based fight system, similar to that of Pokemon, 
        the player must choose their moves strategically to take out the monsters. 
        After defeating each monster the player earns XP, dependent on their 
        performance, which in return allows them to unlock the treasure room.
    </div>

    <div class="paragraph">
        After each fight, the player can upgrade either their maximum health or 
        the damage they deal allowing them to take on higher levelled enemies. 
        Additionally, the player is allowed to take a visit to the prayer room 
        in the church which will heal the Monk allowing them to prepare for 
        future combats.
    </div>

    <div class="paragraph">
        As the game is an Arcade Style RPG I wanted to implement a leaderboard 
        system, once the game is completed successfully the player's name, 
        description and score are written into a text file which can be read 
        from the Main Menu allowing for the players to compare scores.
