        Group work has been a major part of my journey at University, I 
        have been extremely lucky to work with multiple talented groups. 
        One of the outcomes of one of these groups is 'Grab It! Pack It! 
        Smack It!', which was created in my second-year game jam in 
        collaboration with other students on the games development course, 
        as well as members from both the Games Design and Game Art courses.

    <div class="paragraph">
        Grab It! Pack It! Smack It! was developed in a week as part of a 
        second-year group project game jam, it was designed to be a fast-paced 
        game similar to the Overcooked series by Team 17. The game takes place 
        in a warehouse where a tyrant warehouse manager reins. You must collect 
        the orders as quickly, but as carefully as you can to protect the 
        company's reputation.

        During this project, I took the role of lead programmer overseeing a 
        small team of three programmers monitoring their progress and evenly 
        distributing tasks among us. The main tasks that I undertook were the 
        item damage system and the scoring system.
    </div>

    <div class="paragraph">
        The item damage system takes into account how much an item has been 
        damaged by the player in the packing process, such as how hard it 
        hits a wall and damages accordingly. This damage system also affects 
        the score the player receives, as well as how long it takes the player 
        to pack the product.
