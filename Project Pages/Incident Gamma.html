    <div class="paragraph">
        During my final year at the University of Huddersfield, as part of 
        my group project module, I had the pleasure of working with a small 
        group of very talented artists, designers and programmers to produce 
        a small Video Game.

    <div class="paragraph">
        The outcome of this module was 'Incident: Gamma' which was developed 
        using Unreal Engine 5, and loosely based on the events of Chornobyl, 
        where you the player, takes control of a liquidator set with the task 
        of exploring a nuclear reactor to find the source of a radiation leak.

    <div class="paragraph">
        During this project, I was tasked with developing and implementing various 
        features, one of which i arguably the most influential elements of the 
        entire game, the radiation system. Coding a function that decides how much 
        radiation the player takes on depending on how close they are to the source 
        and how strong it is. 
    </div>

    <div class="paragraph">
        Further development of the game is planned, with plans to grow the storyline 
        of the game to create an impactful tale. As well as further advancements in 
        the radiation system to ensure it is as realistic as possible.
